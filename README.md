# PackageTracker
Package Tracker, SWIFT Submission for 'Building Screens' 
Working through RMIT's SWIFT online course, this was my submission for the fourth of 5 courses. The brief was to create an application to track packages. The intention was to show the use of saving and retrieving data as well as UITableViews. There was no requirement to talk to a server or anything it's purely what is stored/saved locally. A user can create a package and modify it's status. There was a bonus requirement to delete packages that had been delivered 7 days ago so this was added too.
